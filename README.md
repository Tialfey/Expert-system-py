I am a student from SRMIST Ramapuram doing my final year in Physics, (RA2031010020003)
This is an expert system that aims to diagnose dengue fever from symptoms ,which will be associated with a probabilistic measure based on the following study:
Khosavanna RR, Kareko BW, Brady AC, Booty BL, Nix CD, Lyski ZL, Curlin ME, Messer WB. Clinical Symptoms of Dengue Infection among Patients from a Non-Endemic Area and Potential for a Predictive Model: A Multiple Logistic Regression Analysis and Decision Tree. Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2021 Jan;104(1):121-129. doi: 10.4269/ajtmh.20-0192. PMID: 33200724; PMCID: PMC7790069.
This is but a tool for an opinion, by no means will it replace a professional opinion
Here i use the predictive values for positive & negative probability as calculated from the above article and multiply them with their respective sensitivity and specificity 
With these values i find a difference , which is compared with a threshold value from self-research and findings, thus this gives a result which tries to diagnose dengue fever with just symptoms.
